# 💊 Pfizer GCS - Supply Chain Operations Analytics

**Clinical Trial Packaging · Plan-Make-Source-Deliver · Operational Intelligence**

> Built as part of interview preparation for the Pfizer Operational Data Analyst Co-op (Global Clinical Supply, Groton CT).  
> Demonstrates end-to-end data analytics engineering: data cleaning → feature engineering → ML modeling → interactive dashboard.

## 📊 Live Dashboard Preview

| Value Stream Map | KPI Dashboard |
|---|---|
| Plan→Make→Source→Deliver with bottleneck flags | 6 live KPIs with filters |

| Anomaly Detection | Demand Forecast |
|---|---|
| Isolation Forest ML - 5% anomaly rate | 6-month outlook with confidence band |

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes **180,519 real supply chain orders** (DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset) to surface operational insights directly relevant to clinical trial packaging operations:

- **57.3% late delivery rate** - systemic, not seasonal
- **First Class shipping = 100% late** - counterintuitive key risk
- **5% anomaly rate** flagged by ML model - high-risk orders for ops review
- **Sharp demand drop in late 2017** - caught early by forecasting pipeline
- **14.7 day total lead time** across 6 packaging process steps

## 📈 Key Findings

### 1. Late Delivery Rate is Systemic
- **57.3%** of all 180,519 orders delivered late
- Consistent across all months (2015–2018) - not seasonal
- Indicates a **process-level issue**, not a one-off disruption

### 2. First Class Shipping = Highest Risk
- **100% late delivery rate** despite being premium shipping
- Root cause: over-scheduling without capacity alignment
- Standard Class performs best at **39.8% late** across 107K orders

### 3. Anomaly Detection - 5% High-Risk Orders
- Isolation Forest ML model trained on 6 operational features
- Flags orders with unusual delay + sales + quantity combinations
- Adjustable sensitivity slider for ops manager use

### 4. Value Stream Map - 14.7 Day Lead Time
| Step | Cycle Time | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Order Planning | 1.2d | LOW |
| Material Sourcing | 2.1d | MEDIUM |
| Packaging Ops | 3.8d | HIGH  |
| QA / Labeling | 2.4d | HIGH  |
| Distribution | 4.2d | HIGH  |
| Site Delivery | 1.0d | MEDIUM |

### 5. Demand Forecasting
- Sharp volume drop in late 2017 (11K → 2K units/month)
- 26 engineered features: lag variables, rolling windows, stockout risk scores
- Random Forest + XGBoost pipeline with time-series cross-validation
